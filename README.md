# Introduction to Python programming language

If you already know that you have Python on your computer, you can
skip this part. These instructions will install `conda` which is a
Python package manager which is cross-platform.

Go to the following address:
https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Choose Python 3 for your system. Follow the installation instructions:
https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

Once the install done, install the following packages using either
the 'Anaconda prompt` (Windows) or a normal terminal (Mac OS X and linux)

``` bash
conda install jupyter numpy nomkl
```
